# 3D-Wireframe-renderer-for-sprig

This is the repo for the 3d wireframe renderer I am working on.
You can try it on the sprig website [here](https://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery/3D_wire_frame_rendererV2)

Soon i will port this to Kaluma js so that it runs without the sprig's OS
and i also plan on making minecraft for the sprig based on this later
